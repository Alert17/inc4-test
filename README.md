Test task for Inc4.

A smart contract has been developed that allows staking, unstaking tokens, and also receiving rewards depending on the staked amount.

The contract was made only for the test task and may contain open vulnerabilities or unoptimized parts.

Deployed in the AirDao Testnet network.

Contract address:
0x23707636c073b6740EEDf63996577aEC8E14C5F8

Tokens and address:
0x5035d097ef6d91117b73F0dB83b441d9D6ABd9B5
0x289256DC52E8B211f833de39678f96dfa80Fe99e

I did not conduct much testing of the contract, since the task was considered for a long time and without strict requirements.

A small server has been developed that allows you to access the contract, listen to events and collect statistics.

General project stack:
Solidity, Nest.js, Prisma.
